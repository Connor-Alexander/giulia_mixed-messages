### Dev log:

> *27th of Feb, 2022*
>   **Connor**: Met via Discord and fiddle-dee-dee'd our way to some starting actions. Step 1 of my responsibilities was to set up the GitHub hosted remote Git repo so we can work individually on our computers if need be, branching as we develop new features whilst keeping the main code clean. I will outline the steps as follows [here](url) from my P.O.V. as I await Giulia's acceptance as a contributor to the project.

### Initial Git Set-Up

1. Use *bash* terminal to create a new local directory, with commands *ls, cd* & *mkdir*.
*to be continued...*
